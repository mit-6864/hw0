All programming assignments in this class will use PyTorch for modeling and optimization. Before you proceed with this section, we strongly suggest you complete the [60 minute deep learning tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) provided by the PyTorch developers. That tutorial is relatively comprehensive; we'll cover only the most essential concepts from the library.\n","\n","A simple way to think about PyTorch is that it's numpy with extra stuff. The most important of the \"extra stuff\" is **automatic differentiation**: PyTorch can keep track of all the computations performed on data and can automatically compute the gradient of any output (e.g., the value of an objective function) with respect to any of the inputs (usually, the model parameters). This makes optimization easy, as all the user (that's you!) has to do is define the model, feed it inputs, and compute the objective function.\n","\n","We'll walk through how to do each of these things for a simple **linear regresion model**. Obviously, this model won't have many moving parts.

So, for example, we will not consider two step transpositions like the following: $abc \\to acb \\to cab$.

There are practical reasons to do this. For example, you could imagine using edit distance in a spell checker system, where some kinds of edits are more unlikely (higher cost) than others. In this assignment, we will say that substituting or transposing a consonant with a vowel, or vice versa, is twice as expensive as substituting/transposing within character class, e.g. editing $abc \\to abd$ counts as 1 edit, but editing $abc \\to aba$ counts as 2.\n","\n","Write an explicit recurrence relation that solves this problem.
